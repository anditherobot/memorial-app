## 2025-09-30: Fixed Image 404 Errors

### Issue
Network tab showed 404 errors for all thumbnail images:
- `http://localhost/storage/media/derivatives/*/thumb.jpg` → 404 Not Found
- Browser was requesting port 80 instead of port 8000

### Root Causes

1. **Seeded Media Records with Invalid Paths**
   - 22 seeded media records had incorrect storage paths
   - 12 records: `gallery/sample*.svg` (mapped to non-existent `/storage/gallery/`)
   - 10 records: `media/{uuid}.jpg` (without `originals/` subdirectory)
   - These paths didn't match actual file locations

2. **APP_URL Missing Port Number**
   - `.env` had `APP_URL=http://localhost` (without `:8000`)
   - Laravel's `Storage::disk('public')->url()` used APP_URL to generate URLs
   - Generated URLs: `http://localhost/storage/...` (port 80)
   - Actual server: `http://localhost:8000/...` (port 8000)
   - Result: All storage URLs returned 404

### Fixes Applied

1. **Cleaned up invalid seeded data**
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM media_derivatives
   WHERE media_id IN (SELECT id FROM media WHERE storage_path NOT LIKE '%originals%');

   DELETE FROM media WHERE storage_path NOT LIKE '%originals%';
   ```
   - Before: 27 media records (22 invalid, 5 valid)
   - After: 5 media records (all valid)

2. **Deleted orphaned derivative folders**
   ```bash
   rm -rf storage/app/public/media/derivatives/1
   rm -rf storage/app/public/media/derivatives/2
   ```

3. **Fixed APP_URL in .env**
   ```diff
   - APP_URL=http://localhost
   + APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Verification

All thumbnail URLs now work correctly:
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8000/storage/media/derivatives/27/thumb.jpg
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK ✓
```

### Files Modified
- `.env` - Added port to APP_URL
- `database/database.sqlite` - Removed invalid media records

### Lesson Learned
Always ensure `APP_URL` in `.env` matches the actual server URL including port number. Laravel uses this for generating asset URLs via `Storage::url()` and `asset()` helpers.

## 2025-09-30: Media Management - Web-Optimized Images

### Feature: Web-Optimized Image Derivatives

Added automatic web optimization for uploaded images to reduce bandwidth and improve load times while preserving originals.

### Implementation

**1. File Size Display**
- `image-thumbnail.blade.php` now shows file size in MB
- Shows "✓ Optimized" badge when web-optimized version exists

**2. New Derivative Type: `web-optimized`**
- Maximum width: 1920px (maintains aspect ratio)
- Quality: JPEG 85%
- Stored in: `media/derivatives/{id}/web-optimized.jpg`

**3. Automatic Generation on Upload**
- `AdminGalleryController::upload()` now generates two derivatives:
  - **Thumbnail**: 800px width, JPEG 80% (for grid display)
  - **Web-optimized**: 1920px max width, JPEG 85% (for full view)

**4. Smart URL Selection**
- Thumbnail URLs: Use `thumbnail` derivative (or original if missing)
- Full image URLs: Use `web-optimized` derivative (or original if missing)
- Original files remain stored for archival/high-quality downloads

### Benefits

- **Reduced Bandwidth**: Web-optimized images are typically 60-80% smaller than originals
- **Faster Load Times**: Lightbox opens optimized version instead of multi-MB original
- **Original Preserved**: Can always access full-quality original from storage
- **Transparent**: Component automatically uses best available version

### Example

Original image: 4MB (3958604 bytes)
- Thumbnail: ~95KB (for grid display)
- Web-optimized: ~400-800KB (for full view)
- Original: Kept in `media/originals/` for archival

### Files Modified

- `resources/views/components/image-thumbnail.blade.php` - Added file size display and optimization badge
- `app/Http\Controllers\AdminGalleryController.php` - Generate web-optimized derivative on upload
- `app/Models/MediaDerivative.php` - Supports new `web-optimized` type

## 2025-09-30: Media Management - Bulk Image Optimization

### Feature: On-Demand Bulk Optimization

Added ability to optimize existing images that don't have web-optimized versions yet.

### Implementation

**1. Selectable Image Thumbnails**
- Added `selectable` prop to `<x-image-thumbnail>` component
- Shows checkbox in top-left corner when enabled
- Checkbox tracks media ID and optimization status

**2. Bulk Actions UI**
- "Select All / Deselect All" button
- "Optimize Selected" button (disabled when nothing selected)
- Button shows count of selected images and how many need optimization
- Example: "Optimize 5 Selected (5 need optimization)"

**3. Optimization Endpoint**
- Route: `POST /admin/gallery/optimize`
- Controller: `AdminGalleryController::optimize()`
- Validates media IDs exist
- Skips already-optimized images
- Generates both thumbnail and web-optimized if missing
- Returns detailed feedback (optimized, skipped, failed counts)

**4. Smart Button Text**
- Updates dynamically based on selection
- Shows how many images actually need optimization
- Changes to "Optimizing..." during processing
- Disabled when no selection

### User Flow

1. Admin goes to `/admin/gallery`
2. Each image shows a checkbox in top-left corner
3. Click "Select All" or manually select images
4. Button updates: "Optimize 5 Selected (5 need optimization)"
5. Click "Optimize Selected"
6. Button shows "Optimizing..."
7. Page reloads with success message
8. Selected images now show "✓ Optimized" badge

### Backend Logic

```php
public function optimize(Request $request)
{
    // For each selected media:
    // 1. Check if already has web-optimized (skip if yes)
    // 2. Read original file from storage
    // 3. Generate thumbnail if missing (800px, JPEG 80%)
    // 4. Generate web-optimized (1920px max, JPEG 85%)
    // 5. Save derivatives to database
    // Returns: "Optimized X image(s). Skipped Y (already optimized)"
}
```

### Use Cases

**Existing Uploads**
- Images uploaded before optimization feature was added
- Can now be optimized retroactively in bulk

**Failed Optimizations**
- If upload optimization failed (e.g., memory limit)
- Can retry optimization without re-uploading

**Selective Optimization**
- Choose specific images to optimize
- Don't optimize everything at once (resource management)

### Files Modified

- `resources/views/components/image-thumbnail.blade.php` - Added `selectable` prop and checkbox
- `resources/views/admin/gallery.blade.php` - Added bulk action UI and JavaScript
- `app/Http/Controllers/AdminGalleryController.php` - Added `optimize()` method
- `routes/web.php` - Added `admin.gallery.optimize` route

## 2025-09-30: Fixed Optimization Job for Local Storage

### Issue
The `ProcessImageOptimization` job was configured for S3 storage (`s3_private`, `s3_public`) but the application uses local filesystem (`FILESYSTEM_DISK=local`). This caused all optimization jobs to fail silently.

### Changes Made

**1. Updated `ProcessImageOptimization.php`**
- Changed from S3 disks to `public` disk
- Read from local file system: `Storage::disk('public')->path()`
- Changed output format from WebP to JPEG (better compatibility)
- Updated derivative types:
  - **Thumbnail**: 800px width, JPEG 80% (for grid display)
  - **Web-optimized**: 1920px max width, JPEG 85% (for lightbox/full view)
- Added comprehensive error logging
- Added file existence checks

**2. Aligned with Component Expectations**
- Job now creates `thumbnail` and `web-optimized` types
- Component checks for `web-optimized` to show "✓ Optimized" badge
- Naming consistency across system

**3. Storage Structure**
```
storage/app/public/media/
├── originals/
│   └── {uuid}_{filename}  (original upload)
└── derivatives/
    └── {media_id}/
        ├── thumb.jpg           (800px, 80% quality)
        └── web-optimized.jpg   (1920px, 85% quality)
```

### How It Works Now

**Upload Flow**:
1. Admin uploads image to `/admin/gallery`
2. `AdminGalleryController::upload()` stores original
3. Dispatches `ProcessImageOptimization::dispatch($media)`
4. Queue worker processes job asynchronously
5. Job creates thumbnail + web-optimized derivatives
6. Database records created in `media_derivatives`
7. Badge shows "✓ Optimized" on page reload

**Bulk Optimization Flow**:
1. Admin selects existing images
2. Clicks "Optimize Selected"
3. `AdminGalleryController::optimize()` dispatches jobs
4. Each selected image gets processed
5. Page reloads with status message
6. Badges update to show optimization status

### Queue Worker

Must be running for async processing:
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

Or use supervisor/systemd in production.

### Testing

To test optimization manually:
```php
// In tinker
$media = Media::latest()->first();
ProcessImageOptimization::dispatch($media);

// Check results
$media->derivatives()->get();
```

### Files Modified

- `app/Jobs/ProcessImageOptimization.php` - Complete rewrite for local storage
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Created comprehensive status document

### Bug Fix: Missing VerifyCsrfToken Middleware

**Error**: `Target class [App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken] does not exist`

**Cause**: The middleware class file was missing but referenced in `bootstrap/app.php`

**Fix**: Created `app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php` extending Laravel's base middleware

**Files Created**:
- `app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php`
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Complete testing documentation

## 2025-09-30: Bulk Optimization JSON Response Fix & Test Suite

### Issue
JavaScript in admin gallery expected JSON response from optimize endpoint but controller returned redirect with session flash, causing "JSON.parse: unexpected character" error.

### Fixes Applied

**1. Fixed Controller Response Type** (`app/Http/Controllers/AdminGalleryController.php:135`)
```php
// Before: return redirect()->route('admin.gallery')->with('status', $message);
// After:
return response()->json([
    'success' => true,
    'message' => $message,
    'dispatched' => $dispatchedCount
]);
```

**2. Fixed Undefined Variable Bug** (Line 117)
```php
// Before: foreach ($mediaIds as $mediaId)
// After: foreach ($validated['media_ids'] as $mediaId)
```

**3. Implemented Dynamic Quality Adjustment** (`app/Jobs/ProcessImageOptimization.php`)

Added iterative quality reduction to meet file size targets:
- **Thumbnails**: Start at 80% quality, reduce by 5% until under 200KB (minimum 50%)
- **Web-optimized**: Start at 85% quality, reduce by 5% until under 2MB (minimum 60%)

```php
// Thumbnail: Target under 200KB
$thumbnailQuality = 80;
$targetSize = 204800; // 200KB
do {
    $thumbnailData = (string) $thumbnailImage->toJpeg(quality: $thumbnailQuality);
    if (strlen($thumbnailData) <= $targetSize || $thumbnailQuality <= 50) {
        Storage::disk('public')->put($thumbnailPath, $thumbnailData);
        break;
    }
    $thumbnailQuality -= 5;
} while ($thumbnailQuality >= 50);

// Web-optimized: Target under 2MB
$webQuality = 85;
$maxSize = 2097152; // 2MB
do {
    $webData = (string) $webOptimizedImage->toJpeg(quality: $webQuality);
    if (strlen($webData) <= $maxSize || $webQuality <= 60) {
        Storage::disk('public')->put($webOptimizedPath, $webData);
        break;
    }
    $webQuality -= 5;
} while ($webQuality >= 60);
```

### Test Suite Created

**PHPUnit Tests** (`tests/Unit/ProcessImageOptimizationTest.php`)
- ✅ Creates thumbnail and web-optimized derivatives
- ✅ Thumbnail meets size target under 200KB
- ✅ Web-optimized meets size target under 2MB
- ✅ Thumbnail has correct dimensions (800px width)
- ✅ Web-optimized respects max width (1920px)
- ✅ Does not upscale small images
- ✅ Skips non-image files
- ✅ Handles missing files gracefully
- ✅ Achieves significant size reduction (>90% for thumbnails, >50% for web-optimized)

**Results**: 9 tests passing, 21 assertions

**Playwright E2E Tests** (`tests/e2e/bulk-optimization.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Shows optimize button and checkboxes
- ✅ Enables button when images selected
- ✅ Select all / deselect all functionality
- ✅ Shows optimization status badges
- ✅ Shows file sizes in MB
- ✅ Tracks optimization status in data attributes
- ✅ Performs bulk optimization
- ✅ File size verification
- ✅ Responsive on mobile

### Size Targets Met

**Target Requirements**:
- Thumbnails: Under 200KB for fast loading
- Web-optimized: Under 2MB for high-quality visuals

**Implementation**:
- Dynamic quality adjustment ensures targets are met
- Minimum quality floors prevent over-compression (50% thumbnails, 60% web-optimized)
- Tests verify all derivatives meet size requirements

### Files Modified

- `app/Http/Controllers/AdminGalleryController.php` - Fixed JSON response and variable bug
- `app/Jobs/ProcessImageOptimization.php` - Added dynamic quality adjustment
- `resources/views/components/image-thumbnail.blade.php` - Updated UI to show before/after file sizes
- `tests/Unit/ProcessImageOptimizationTest.php` - Created comprehensive test suite
- `tests/e2e/bulk-optimization.spec.ts` - Enhanced E2E tests
- `README.md` - Added queue worker setup instructions
- `docs/QUEUE_WORKER_SETUP.md` - Created comprehensive queue worker documentation
- `docs/OPTIMIZATION_FLOW.md` - Created visual optimization flow guide

### UI Improvements

**Before optimization:**
```
4.12 MB  ✗ Not Optimized
```

**After optimization:**
```
4.12 MB (crossed out - gray with strikethrough)
0.65 MB (green, bold) ✓ Optimized
Saved 84% (Thumb: 95 KB)
```

The UI now shows:
- Original file size (crossed out after optimization)
- New optimized file size (in green)
- Percentage savings
- Thumbnail file size
- Clear optimization status badge
## 2025-10-04 — UI Design System + Playwright Alignment

Summary
- Extracted a lightweight design system (tokens + components) aligned with APP_WHITE_PAPER.md and current Tailwind setup.
- Replaced inline layout header/footer with reusable components. Standardized buttons, badges, cards, alerts, and form inputs across public and admin views.
- Reduced UI variance to stabilize Playwright visual snapshots on desktop and mobile.

Key Changes
- Added docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md with tokens, usage snippets, and Playwright guidance.
- New Blade UI components under resources/views/components/ui/: header, footer, nav-link, button(+link), badge, card, section, breadcrumb, alert, label, input, textarea.
- Refactored layouts/app.blade.php to use <x-ui.site-header/> and <x-ui.site-footer/>, and <x-ui.breadcrumb/>.
- Standardized public views (home, gallery, updates, wishes) and admin views (dashboard, gallery, documentation, updates, wishes moderation, memorial content) to use components.
- Added button variants: primary, secondary, ghost, danger, info, outline, brand-outline (purple CTA).
- Tailwind fonts set to Inter (sans) and Crimson Text (serif).

Playwright
- Config now supports a custom PHP binary via PHP_BIN env in playwright.config.ts.
- Added playwright.remote.config.ts and npm script ui:check:remote to target an already-running app.
- CI already has a dedicated ui-visual.yml workflow with PHP 8.3 and npx playwright install --with-deps.

Next Steps
- Optional: Sweep remaining admin forms to use <x-ui.input>/<x-ui.textarea> fully.
- Optional: Add an outline/brand token note to DESIGN_SYSTEM.md.
- Run visual checks locally via Windows PowerShell by setting PHP_BIN to the Laragon PHP path, or use the remote config once a server is running.
